# Network-Scanner

Python script uses the scapy library to perform network scanning tasks. It starts by identifying active hosts on a given IP range using ARP requests, then conducts port scanning using TCP SYN packets to find open ports. Finally, it performs basic vulnerability scanning by checking for common services running on detected open ports.
